This questionnaire evaluates your functional capacity for a range of activities. No days are the same. Base your 
response on an average day during the last month – not the worst nor the best. If a question concerns an activity that 
you have not performed, such as showering while seated because you always shower standing up, then score as you 
think this activity would have affected you.
Items described include necessary activities to perform them. Example: “Going to a shop for groceries” includes 
getting dressed and as necessary travelling.
It is a good idea to answer the questionnaire together with someone who sees you in everyday life.

What are the consequences for you if you perform the activities described below?
To what extent does this affect how much else you can do?
