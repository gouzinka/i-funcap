*This questionnaire evaluates your functional capacity for a range of activities.* No days are the same. Base your response on an average day during the last month – not the worst nor the best.%%
*If a question concerns an activity that you have not performed*, such as showering while seated because you always shower standing up, then score as you think this activity would have affected you.%%
